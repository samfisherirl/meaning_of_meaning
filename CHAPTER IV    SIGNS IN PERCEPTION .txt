Though with the growth of knowledge we have become 
much less certain than our ancestors about what chairs 
and tables are, physicists and philosophers have not 
yet succeeded in putting the question entirely beyond 
discussion. Every one agrees that chairs and tables 
are perfectly good things—they are there and can be 
touched—but all competent to form an opinion are 
equally agreed that whatever we see is certainly not 
them. What shall we do about it? 

Why scientists and others are now agreed that what 
we see is not chairs and tables will be at once obvious 
if we consider what we do see when we look at such 
objects. On the other hand, the accounts given of 
what we do see have not taken the matter further, owing 
to bad habits, which we form in tender years, of mis¬ 
naming things which interest us. The following, for 
example, is a common method of procedure illustrating 
the way in which these habits arise :— 

“ I remember on one occasion wanting the word 
for Table. There were five or six boys standing 
round, and, tapping the table with my forefinger, 
I asked, ‘ What is this ? ’ One boy said it was a 
dodela, another that it was an etanda, a third stated 
that it was bokcUi^ a fourth that it was damba, and 



78 THE MEANING OF MEANING 

the fifth said it was meza. These various words 
we wrote in our note-book, and congratulated our¬ 
selves that we were working among a people who 
possessed so rich a language that they had five 
words for one article.”^ 

The assumption of the reverend gentleman is that, 
having asked a definite question, he was entitled to a 
definite answer. Very little study of what he actually 
saw or tapped might have saved him the trouble of 
discovering at a later stage that “ one lad had thought 
we wanted the word for tapping; another understood 
we were seeking the word for the material of which the 
table was made; another had an idea that we required 
the word for hardness; another thought we wished for 
a name for that which covered the table ; and the last, 
not being able, perhaps, to think of anything else 
gave us the word vneza, table—the very word we were 
seeking.” 

A similar discovery awaits the experts, and it may 
not be inapposite to indicate the main features of this 
imminent advance in knowledge. It is at first sight 
surprising that modern investigators should have been 
so long in taking up the analysis of sign-situations as 
begun by Aenesidemus and Occam. But their un¬ 
easiness in matters which they supposed to fall within 
the domain of ‘the metaphysicians,' seems to have 
been sufficient to inhibit their curiosity as to the prin¬ 
ciples of interpretation involved at every stage of their 
work. Moreover, so long as controversy with specialists 
in other fields was avoided, a great deal could be 
achieved without the realization that perception can 
only be treated scientifically when its character as a 
sign-situation is analysed. 

The isolated utterance of Helmholtz is therefore all 
the more significant, for not only was Helmholtz one 
of the profoundest scientific thinkers of modern times.

but, as we know from his correspondence, he took 
throughout his life a lively interest in philosophic con¬ 
troversies. In 1856 we even find him referring to 
the problem of the way in which we pass from simple 
sensations to judgments of perception as one to which 
no modern philosopher had devoted serious attention. 
He was much influenced by Kant, who, in spite of 
his disconcerting technique, seems constantly on the 
verge of approaching the central issues of interpretation, 
and who has been claimed as the most convinced 
Nominalist of modern times: ^ but there is nothing 
particularly Kantian about the theory of signs which 
can be found in various parts of Helmholtz’ writings.® 
Our knowledge, he contended, takes the form of signs, 
and those signs we interpret as signifying the unknown 
relation of things in the external world. The sensations 
which lie at the basis of all perceptions are subjective 
signs of external objects.® The qualities of sensations 
are not the qualities of objects. Signs are not pictures 
of reality. 

“A sign need have no kind of similarity whatever 
with what it signifies. The relation consists simply 
in the fact that the same object acting under similar 
circumstances arouses the same sign, so that different 
signs correspond always to different sensations.” * 

In discuss/ng the way in which we interpret sensa¬ 
tions in terms of an external world, Helmholtz has 
occasion to point out that the multiplicity of the optical 
signs which we use is such that we need not be sur¬ 
prised at the variety and complexity of the news which 
they give us. The elementary signs of language are 
only 26 letters If out of these 26 letters we can 
get the whole of literature and science, the 250,000 
optic nerve fibres can be relied on for an even richer 
and more finely graded knowledge.

THE MEANING OF MEANING 


What do we see when we look at a table? First 
and foremost, a lighted region containing some air, 
lit by rays coming partly from the direction of the table, 
partly from other sources ; then the further boundaries 
of this region, surfaces of objects, including part of the 
surface of the table. If now we point at what we see 
and name it This^ we are in danger, if our attention is 
concentrated on the table, of saying: This is a Table. 
So that we must be careful. And where is colour 
according to this scheme? Somewhere in the eye, as 
anyone who cares to strike his eye will discover. 

What we have described is not the Table, though 
part of what we have described is part of the table. 
Anything which we say under these circumstances which 
involves the Table must also involve Interpretatton. We 
interpret a sign, some part of what is given,* as signifying 
something other than itself, in this case the table. 

But this is not the whole of the story, and here it 
seems possible to say something quite new. It would 
be strange to suggest that we see anything which is 
not in front of the eye, or which does not, like a musca 
vohtans, throw images on the retina. Thus purists will 
have to maintain that we never see colours. Yet it is 
colours and such directly apprehended entities that are 
the initial signs on which all interpretation, all inference, 
all knowledge is based. And what is 'it that by in¬ 
terpretation we come to know? It is what is present— 
a whole which, as we learn in course of time, is com- 

^ It has long been recognized that there is something amiss with 
the term Datum The ' given ' is often of all things the most difficult 
to accept 

(i) A thing can be a ' Datum,' given in the sense that it is what 
IS actually Resent with all its characters, whether we know what 
they are or not, and whether we cognize it rightly or not. 

(u) In a narrower sense, only those entities which are directly appre¬ 
hended, I e , are actually modifications of our sense-organs, are said to be 
given—the ' Datum datissimum ' , and their alleged possessor, or remote 
cause, the tables, atoms, etc , is only a datum as being present, or part 
of which IS present in sense (i) 

Thus a datum, m sense (i), can be said to have * an appearance ‘ 
which IS a datum in sense (ii) A ‘ total visible cone ' is a datum in 
sense (i), and ‘ something elliptical' a datum in sense (ii)

posed of the lighted region, the air, etc., to which 
we allude above, but in which we only distinguish 
these namable components after a long process of 
interpretation conducted on experimental methods— 
“The infant learns first, etc., etc.” 

What then is this direct apprehending to which so 
important a role is assigned? The correct answer is 
usually rejected without hesitation, so contrary is it 
to some of our favourite verbal habits. To be directly 
apprehended is to cause certain happenings in the 
nerves, as to which at present neurologists go no 
further than to assert that they occur. Thus what is 
directly apprehended is a modification of a sense organ, 
and Its apprehension is a further modification of the 
nervous system, about which we may expect information 
at some future date.* 

But this is mere materialism? Suitably misunder¬ 
stood, it IS. In Itself, however, it is no more than a highly 
probable step in the most plausible systematic account 
of ‘ knowing ’ which can be given. On all other 
accounts yet suggested, at least one indefinable idea 
has at some point to be introduced, at least one 
ultimately and irredeemably mysterious extra entity 
has to be postulated—some relation of ‘ immediate 
knowing’ and further inexpiicables in its train. Mean¬ 
while It IS generally granted that much is known. There 
are the sciences; and it is here urged that we already 
have the material for an account of knowing itself— 
provided, that is, certain symbolic entanglements are 
first penetrated or swept aside. 

^ As a direct objection to this it is often argued that a ‘ sense-datum ' 
seems very unlike a modification of the retina, but so is passing through 
a station in an express very unlike what the station-master sees Here 
there is only one event, ue passage of the tram , but the signs are 
very different Similarly with the ‘ sense-datum' We should expect 
the greatest difference between the references involved—the referents 
being the same—since one, direct apprehension, is as simple as possible, 
a first order reference, and the other, reference to a sense organ modi¬ 
fication, IS immensely complicated and arrived at only after a long chain 
of interpretations It is another order of reference This all-important 
problem of orders or levels of references and of signs is further discussed 
in the following chapter (pp 93-4). 



82 THE MEANING OF MEANING 

The chief of these rest upon misunderstanding as 
to the nature of statement. To make a statement is to 
symbolize a reference. What a reference is we have 
seen in the preceding chapter. However much we 
may try, we cannot go beyond reference in the way 
of knowledge. True reference is reference to a set of 
referents as they hang together. False reference is 
reference to them as being in some other arrangement 
than that in which they actually hang together. The 
advance in knowledge is the increase in our power of 
referring to referents as they actually hang together. 
This is all we can do. By no manner of make-believe 
can we discover the what of referents. We can only 
discover the how. This is, of course, old and familiar 
doctrine but it needs to be reaffirmed whenever the 
metaphysician intervenes, whether he comes as a 
materialist, spiritualist, dualist, realist or with any other 
answer to an impossible question. Unfortunately in 
our present ignorance of the mechanism of language, 
he has a good opportunity of setting up apparently 
impenetrable barriers. The only way by which these 
may be avoided is to set out from the known facts as 
to how we acquire knowledge. Then with an account 
of interpretation, such as that which is here sketched, 
the way is open to the systematization of all that is 
known and further of all that will ever come to be 
known.^ 

To resume our outline sketch of a systematic account 
of perception. Directly apprehended retinal modifica¬ 
tions such as colours, are therefore initial signs of 
‘ objects ’ and ‘ events ’ (or however we agree to symbolize 

^ A certain sense of chill or disappointment is not uncommon in 
those who entertain such a view for the first time The renunciations 
which seem to be involved by the restnctipn of knowledge to reference, 
dimimsh, however, when due attention is paid to those other ' non- 
symbolic' uses of language which are discussed in Chapter X It 
has often been said that Metaphysics is a hybrid of science and poetry. 
It has many of the marks of the hybrid ; it is stenle, for example The 
proper sepuation of these ill-assorted mates is one of the most important 
consequences of the mvestigation into symbolism

referents); characters of things which we discover by 
interpretation, such as shapes of cones or tables, are 
signs of second or third order respectively. On the 
other hand shapes of initial signs, e.g. retinal modi¬ 
fications, are first order signs. 

Place a new nickel florin on the palm of the hand 
with the arm extended horizontally, and note that a 
truthful person would describe its shape as elliptical. 
Now look at it vertically from above and agree that it 
is round. Is the florin circular or elliptical ? What an 
insoluble problem I 

If we say that it is the surface of the florin which is 
given us in both cases, then it seems to be both circular 
and elliptical. Which is absurd—since we ‘know,’ 
and every physicist stoutly maintains,* that it has not 
measurably changed, and is actually circular. We 
have, therefore, the option on the one hand of 
opining with the Metaphysicians that the Universe 
is very paradoxical, with the polite Essayists that it is 
very odd, or with the Bishops that it is very wonderful; 
or, on the other, of saying that it is not the surface 
which is given in either sense. 

Anyone who watched our procedure with the florin, 
if appealed to for assistance at this point, would say 
that what lyas present in each case was a whole con¬ 
taining as parts, cones ‘ whose apices are in the eye, 
and whose bases are the limits of our vision, or, where 
objects such as florins are about, their surfaces. Here 
there are two cones with the circular surface of the 
florin for base. In the first case the cone is elliptical 


1 As Rougier says (Paralogtsmes, p 408), the theory ot pnmary and 
secondary qualities, which seemed to have been disposed oi by Berkeley's 
arguments, is once more receiving senous attention " Nous n’avons 
aucun motif s£neux pour penser que les sensations de forme gfom£tnque 
ne soient pas objectives^' But it is hardly suffiaent to dismiss the 
matter with the remark that the paradox of the bent stick, " n'existe 
que pour celui qui ne connalt pas les lois de la refraction de la lumiere " 
Apart from an adequate Theory of Signs the laws of refraction make 
a poor show agamst the ingenuity of the ontologist 
^ 'The word ' cone ' is used here merely to fill in a Imguistic gap and 
by metaphor It is shorthand for ' region intervemng between surface 
and retma,' which m most cases is conical or pyramidal in shape 



84 THE MEANING OF MEANING 

in cross-section, and the surface of the florin is an 
oblique section ; in the second case the cone is circular, 
and the surface of the florin a cross-section, also circular. 
What here is taken as the apparent shape of the florin 
is most plausibly said to be the cross-section of the 
cone. This is the sign which we interpret as the 
surface, and in no case is that surface a ‘ datum datis- 
simum ’—directly given. This simple application of 
the Theory of Signs frees us from the paradox, the 
oddness, and the wonder, restores our faith in the 
physicist, and enables us to get on with our business, 
viz., a proper account of perception of the Nature 
of Things. 

The method by which this ancient scandal is re¬ 
moved may be applied with equal success to all the 
other ‘fundamental problems.’ Whenever the in¬ 
genious mind discovers a self-contradiction (“This 
same florin that I see is both round and elliptical,” or 
“ This same stick which I see in the water is both 
straight and bent ”) bad symbolization is indicated, and 
we must expand the peccant symbol ‘ until we discover 
the ambiguous sign-situation which caused the trouble. 
We then note this ambiguity, and improve our sym¬ 
bolism so as to avoid the nonsense to which we shall 
otherwise be led. Thus in the case of the florin we 
say : “The base of this cone that is my sign is oblique 
and circular, and is the surface of the florin that I see; 
but a normal section of this cone is elliptical. I can 
equally be said to see the florin or to see any section 
of the cone, but no one of these is directly given. Even 
the whole cone of which they are parts is picked out 
from the wider cone which includes besides the florin 
cone the cones of all that I am seeing, the total datum 
which is my field of view.” 

This selection of partial cones out of the total cone 

* In the case of the flonn, to " This cone that I see, whose base is 
the florin, is both round and elliptical ” Here the sign, namely, the 
cone, may be interpreted as sigmfying either an ellipb^ cross-section, 
t e., normal section, or a circular oblique section. 



SIGNS IN PERCEPTION 85 

which is the visual field is, in normal circumstances, 
effected without mistake. It might, in fact, never have 
been suspected that even here interpretation is at work, 
were it not for the case of ‘double images.’ For each 
eye there is a separate total cone, but we learn normally 
to identify certain partial cones within these as having 
the same base. If the retinal correspondence through 
which we do this is upset (as when we push the eyeball 
a little, or look past a near at a distant object) we fail 
to make the right identification, and say we see two 
florins (double-images). Here once again we let our 
language trick us. What is present is, as always in 
binocular vision, two cones with a common base. 
Thanks to the retinal shift, the normal, automatic 
method of identification breaks down, and we ‘ see ’ 
one florin as though it were in two places ; we interpret 
two cones with a common base as though they were 
cones with separate bases. Reflection and refraction— 
the whole of the theory of vision is full of such 
‘ puzzles,’ to be solved by the above Theory of Signs.* 
Through this Theory of Signs then we can not only 
remove the standard pre-scientific paradoxes, but pro¬ 
vide a new basis for Physics. It is commonly assumed 
that contrasted with what we see are the things we 
imagine, which are in some sense unreal. This dis¬ 
tinction betwleen Vision and Imagination is misleading, 
and of those things which we rightly claim to see the 
parts we do not see are as real as those we do. The 

1 In connection with sign-situations, a few words are required with 
regard to the most resolute attempt to deal with data in terms of 
signs since Reid's Inquiry —that developed at p 24 fi of Professor John 
Laird’s Studies in Realism " The visual sense-datum," says Professor 
Laird, " is as much a sign as a fact, and it is always apprehended so ” 
He goes on to state that we always perceive Significance (the relation 
in virtue of which a sign signifies), we always perceive sign-facts, not 
data devoid of sigmficdnce Thus, when he adds that " meaning is 
directly perceptible just like colour or sound,” if we understand ' mean¬ 
ing ' in the sense of ' significance,' this assertion is not so paradoxical 
as it would be if ' meaning' were confused with ‘ what is meant.' 
Cf Hoernl^, Mind, 1907, p 86—" I regard the consciousness of meaning 
as primary and fundamental, and the distinction between sign and 
meaning as a product of reflection " What kind of ' meamug ' this is

other side of the moon, which we never see, is as real 
as the Side which vision perceives. The atoms, whose 
paths are photographed, the electrons which we do not 
‘see’, are, if this interpretative effort of the physicist 
be sustained, as real as the signs given to perception 
from which he starts. When we look at our chairs 
and tables we ‘ see ’ a datum datissimum, then cones, 
then surfaces, chair, legs-seat-back, wood, bamboo, 
fibres, cells, molecules, atoms, electrons . . . the many 
senses of ‘ see ’ proceeding in an ordered hierarchy as 
the sign-situations change. And as the point of view, 
interest, scientific technique or purpose of investigation 
alters, so will the levels represented by these references 
change in their turn. 



CHAPTER V 


THE CANONS OF SYMBOLISM 

A happy nomenclature has sometimes been mote 
powerful than rigorous logic in allowing a new tram 
of thought to be quickly and generally accepted — 

Ptof A Schuster 

For the rest I should not be displeased, sir, did you 
enter a little fartlier into the details of the turns of 
mind which appear marvellous in the use of the 
particles — Lcibnit: 

At the basis of all communication are certain postulates 
or pre-requisites — regulative presumptions without 
which no system of symbols, no science, not even 
logic, could develop. Their neglect by logicians is 
not surprising, since it has hitherto been nobody’s 
business to discuss them. Logic, which may be 
regarded as the science of the systemati 7 ation of 
symbols, has been preoccupied either with judgments 
which are psychological, or with ‘propositions,’ which 
were treated as objects of thought, distinct from 
symbols and not psychological. Modern mathemati¬ 
cians, who have done so much for the formal develop¬ 
ment of Symbolic method, either tacitly assume these 
Canons, or when confronted by difficulties due to their 
neglect, introduce additional ere/ hoc complexities* into 
their systems. Actually they are as essential to all 
discourse as chemistry to physiology, dynamics to 
ballistics, or psychology to aislhetics. In any logic 
which is not purely formal, in the sense of being

88 THE MEANING OF MEANING 

devoted to some elaboration of the possibilities of 
symbol-manipulation,* the study of these Canons is a 
first essential, and their strict observance would render 
otiose whole tracts of the traditional treatment. 

It will be convenient to state some of these Canons 
in terms of Symbols and Referents. The triangle of 
Reference given on p. ii should be consulted. The 
First Canon of Symbolism, the Canon of Singularity, 
is as follows:— 

I.— One Symbol stands for one and only one Referent. 

This one referent may be, and in most cases is, 
complex. ‘ All Mongolian Imbeciles,’ for instance, is 
a symbol which has one referent Similarly (;r or y) 
has one referent. The symbols of mathematics, how¬ 
ever, are peculiar in that they are symbols either of 
other symbols or of operations with symbols. This 
peculiarity is what is often expressed by saying that 
pure mathematics is abstract, or formal, or that it does 
not mention anything at all. Symbols may contain 
necessary parts, e.g., the negative, and words like ‘ the ’ 
and ‘ which,’ which themselves have no specific referents. 
The study of such non-symbolic structural elements of 
symbols is the business of grammar. 

These indications of structure appear in ordinary 
language in a bewildering variety of forms. The 
infiexions, the conjunctions, distributives, auxiliary verbs, 
some of the prepositions, the main use of the copula, etc., 
all have this function. In mathematics, owing to the 
simplicity of its outlook, these structural elements are 
reduced to the minimum; otherwise such symbols for 
counting operations as two and three, or such symbols 
of symbols as algebraic expressions could never be 
handled systematically. Recent views on mathematics 
show a refreshing reaction from the logical mysticism or

R. M Eaton deals interestingly with the rules of a logical syntax
